Thanks a lot to Manuel Rubio <manuel@altenwald.com> for writing initial implementation of MySQL protocol and remember,
that his code is also distributed AS IS + it is EPL, so do not close this source.

Take a look at his code at https://github.com/altenwald/myproto  It is under LGPL there but we have took it when it was under EPL.


Also this repository has code distributed by MIT from third party:

src/sql92_parser.yrl  (and generated from it src/sql92_parser.erl)
src/sql92_scan.xrl  (and generated from it src/sql92_scan.erl)

Many thanks to Oleg Smirnov <oleg.smirnov@gmail.com>  and his work https://github.com/master/mongosql for this
fast and convenient SQL parser
